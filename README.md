# DapperExample.API

`DapperExample.API` is a simple API that demonstrates how to integrate **Dapper** with **ASP.NET Core** using the **Repository Pattern** for data access, along with **Swagger UI** for easy API documentation and testing. This project also customizes Swagger's appearance using a custom CSS file for a modern and attractive UI.

## Features

- **Dapper Integration:** Demonstrates how to use Dapper with SQL Server to perform CRUD operations.
- **Repository Pattern:** Implements the repository pattern to manage data access and keep the code clean and maintainable.
- **Swagger UI Customization:** Includes custom CSS for an attractive and modern Swagger UI design.
- **SQL Stored Procedures:** The application utilizes stored procedures for database operations, providing a robust and scalable approach to interact with the database.
- **EF Core (for migrations):** Uses EF Core for managing database schema migrations and model mapping.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 6/7**: Backend framework to build RESTful APIs.
- **Dapper**: A lightweight ORM used for database operations.
- **SQL Server**: Relational database used for data storage.
- **Swagger UI**: Used for API documentation and testing.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: Used for managing database schema migrations and model mapping.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- SQL Server (local or remote)
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio (Optional)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DapperExample.API.git
```


### 2. Set Up the Database

Ensure you have a SQL Server instance running. The project uses stored procedures, and the schema will be created using **Entity Framework Core** migrations.

#### Connection String

Make sure to update your connection string in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_database;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;"
  }
}
```


You can create the necessary tables and stored procedures manually or use **EF Core Migrations**.

#### Seed Data

In the `OnModelCreating` method of `AppDbContext`, there is a seeding logic for initial data setup. Ensure that this data is loaded when you run the application.

### 3. Run the Project

1. Restore the NuGet packages:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

2. Apply migrations to create the database schema:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

   The API will be hosted on `https://localhost:5001` (by default).

### 4. Access the Swagger UI

Once the application is running, open your browser and go to:

https://localhost:5001/swagger


This will load the Swagger UI where you can test the available API endpoints.

### 5. Interact with the API

You can now use the **Swagger UI** to interact with the API. The `CategoryController` is exposed for CRUD operations on categories, and each action has corresponding buttons (e.g., `Try it out`, `Execute`) to test the endpoints directly.

### 6. Custom Swagger UI Styling

This project customizes the default Swagger UI with a custom CSS file. The following styles have been applied:

- Modern gradient background.
- Custom button colors and hover effects.
- Updated header and operation block styles for better readability and aesthetics.
- Responsive design for a better user experience.

### 7. Using Dapper and Stored Procedures

This project demonstrates the use of **Dapper** for querying the database and using stored procedures for all CRUD operations. The following stored procedures are created to manage categories:

### Stored Procedures

Here are the stored procedures used in this project:

#### `sp_GetAllCategories`

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_GetAllCategories
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT Id, Name
    FROM Categories
    ORDER BY Name;
END
```

#### `sp_GetCategoryById`

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_GetCategoryById
    @CategoryId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT Id, Name
    FROM Categories
    WHERE Id = @CategoryId;
END
```

#### `sp_InsertCategory`

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_InsertCategory
    @Name NVARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Categories (Name)
    VALUES (@Name);
END
```

#### `sp_UpdateCategory`

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_UpdateCategory
    @CategoryId INT,
    @Name NVARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Categories
    SET Name = @Name
    WHERE Id = @CategoryId;
END
```

#### `sp_DeleteCategory`

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_DeleteCategory
    @CategoryId INT
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM Categories
    WHERE Id = @CategoryId;
END
```

### API Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/categories`: Retrieves all categories.
- `GET /api/categories/{id}`: Retrieves a category by its ID.
- `POST /api/categories`: Adds a new category.
- `PUT /api/categories/{id}`: Updates an existing category.
- `DELETE /api/categories/{id}`: Deletes a category.
